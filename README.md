# Paint
## Developed a Java application that draws geometric shapes, moves them, copies them and deletes them, and can dynamically load any shape to draw.
## During this project :
### ● I designed an object-oriented model for geometric shapes.
### ● I applied the OOP concepts of inheritance and polymorphism to my design.
### ● I created an advanced GUI with 2D Graphics capabilities.
